### TASK: An image recognition model to identify the model of a car from an image.

* 1.Create a model/algorithm that identifies the object(s) in an image.

* 2.Create the training data for just one car model for example" Maruti Suzuki Swift" and train the model to identify all Maruti Swift model images accurately for all vehicle colours.

* 3.The model should work such that if I upload a swift image, it should provide a very high confidence level/probability of it as Maruti Swift and show it as "MATCH". If I upload any other car model image such a tata Nano, it should identify it as a "NO MATCH" because of less probability.

* 4.Make this model as a web application so that as a use I can upload an image and the result can be shown on the same screen.

* 5.The application should be hosted on a URL (use any free cloud server of your choice e.g. Heroku). Share the link with us once hosted.

### Tips:

* 1. Please use reusable libraries for image detection and classification.

* 2. Write the model and code in any language you are familiar with such as R, Python, SAS or any other language.

* 3. For the web application, use any language of your choice.


#### Note : Training Set will be available soon.Till then you make a model with google search Maruti Suzuki car Image
