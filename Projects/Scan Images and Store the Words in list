Write a standalone script either in Python or C++ to read images (of documents / invoices attached below) and detect all the words (line-wise only) present in the image for OCR and store the words location in a list. Perform necessary preprocessing steps like noise removal and binarization.

Mention all the dependencies and steps to run your script in a Readme file. No applications will be accepted without this.

Note :- Don't Forget to download the images [from here](https://github.com/shubhagrwl/Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Practice-Project/blob/master/Projects/input_images.zip)
